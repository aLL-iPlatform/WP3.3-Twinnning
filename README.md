# WP3.3-Twinnning
Twinning is replicated against surrogate, model is at cloud cluster.

Twinning is replicated against surrogate, model is at cloud cluster, delivered on
demonstration model at cloud

The purpose of this python program is to build a physical surrogate model using physical data to replicate a digital twin of a blended aircraft concept model. 
It then monitors, controls, and updates the model in order to optimize it for carbon neutrality, efficiency, and sustainability throughout the product lifecycle, and also creates reports and visualizations to track progress. 
The necessary libraries to execute this algorithm are numpy, tensorflow, and the tensorflow.keras layers library.

#Importing necessary libraries
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Flatten, Conv2D, MaxPool2D

#Loading the data
(X_train, y_train), (X_test, y_test) = tf.keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()

#Reshaping the data
X_train = X_train.reshape(X_train.shape[0], 28, 28, 1)
X_test = X_test.reshape(X_test.shape[0], 28, 28, 1)

#Normalizing the data
X_train = X_train / 255.0
X_test = X_test / 255.0

#Defining the model
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
